## Current checkpoint

- Completed: T00–T02 merged; PR #3538 merged as `b4ba6320797f056da19bbdc5cc672b3a97d2091e`. T02's formal Tier 2 deferral acknowledgment was recorded before merge. Tier 2 backend-dependent specs remain `NOT_RUN`; they are not represented as passed.
- Changed and validated in T02: queue-settings loading/save protection, stale draft conflict metadata, logout isolation, correct dirty state after edits during save, defensive storage access, and removal of fabricated controls. See `EVIDENCE.md#t02` for separate local and GitHub validation snapshots.
- T03 scope: cabinet read contract only. The current patch defaults an omitted day to clinic-local today, returns typed queue owner and default cabinet alongside the saved day assignment, derives displayed statistics from the same filtered read, treats changed defaults as informational, and distinguishes load failure from empty results.
- Completed in T03: backend tests 14/14; final component tests 3/3; full Vitest 2,877/2,877; type-check; scoped ESLint; direct pinned Stylelint; theme and icon audits; production build; UI baseline ratchet; strict locale parity; OpenAPI/frontend-type generation; post-commit generated-types parity; PR body gate (19 checks). Code commit: `e9448bca543fcb98595c63ef086fdfeb47a8dd52`.
- Changed but not verified: GitHub CI/Playwright and first-screen browser timing. The exact `lint:check` wrapper failed locally because Stylelint was absent from PATH after the ESLint stage passed; the pinned cached Stylelint 16.26.1 run passed directly. `git diff --check` passed after final code and ledger edits.
- Remaining: commit the OpenAPI serialization correction and wait for required GitHub checks on the new PR head; resolve any further red check in PR #3540.
- Blocker: initial PR head failed OpenAPI freshness only because the committed generated JSON had a final LF that the CI serializer does not emit. The correction removes only that LF. Merge still requires green Tier 1 CI and formal acknowledgment if Tier 2 remains deferred. Staging timing is `NOT_RUN`; T02 Tier 2 is also `NOT_RUN`.
- Next exact action: commit the generated OpenAPI serialization correction with only `end-of-file-fixer` skipped, push, and monitor CI for the new head.
- Checks to rerun after the next change: `git diff --check`, `npm.cmd run generate:api-types:check`, and the GitHub CI gates for PR #3540.
